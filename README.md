# MIMICS
MIMICS Code Repository

Created by Will Wieder:
Code for used to generate sumulations for MIMICS in:
Wieder et al. Geosci. Model Dev. Discuss., 8, 2011–2052, 2015  doi:10.5194/gmdd-8-2011-2015
Data or findings that are based on this model, or it's derevations, please cite the manuscript above

LIDET Simulations require site level observed data (see Table C1 in GMDD manuscript, and associated citations)
Data are included here as a seperate .csv file

Results presented in Fig. 2 & Table 1 also require LIDET observations, 
These data were provided by Bil Parton & published in: 
Bonan et al. Global Change Biology, 19, 957–974, 2013 doi: 10.1111/gcb.120312013  
[available on request]

Updates to the MIMICS code are archived for a sensitivy analysis led by Ben Sulman looking at changes in soil C pools in response to environmental perturbations in idealized simulations. Files used for these runs include
- MIMICS2_testing_reverse_modfPHYS_Sept7_2016.R (source code)
- Test_SITES_1.csv (site conditions for idealized experiments)
- parameters_LIDET-MIM-REV_test_lowKM.csv (model parameters)
